  session_description:
    Data from macaque performing a working and long-term memory task. A
    session switches in a block-like fashion between a long- and a short-term 
    memory task. In the short-term memory task, the subject is presented with 
    three objects placed in random locations in the periphery. The subject must 
    respond by retrieving and saccading to the location of a cued object after 
    a short delay. In the long-term memory task, the objects are not presented 
    in their corresponding locations. Instead, the subject must respond 
    according to a set of learned long-term object-location associations.
