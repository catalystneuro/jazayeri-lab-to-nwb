  session_description:
    Data from macaque performing mental navigation task. Subject is
    presented with a start and a target landmark, sampled from a linear
    map of 6 landmarks on a screen. After a delay, the subject is then cued 
    with a go signal to navigate from start to target landmark with a
    joystick. Subject should respond by deflecting the joystick in the right
    direction and holding it until the subject thinks it has arrived at the target
    landmark. The visual drift or intervening landmarks are all occluded from view
    making the task a purely mental navigation.
